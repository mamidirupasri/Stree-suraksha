# Stree-suraksha
Stree Suraksha is a women’s safety system combining AI, ML, IoT, and Bluetooth Mesh technologies. It uses motion detection and heart rate sensors for multi-step threat verification, sends real-time SOS alerts with live GPS, and supports optional audio recording post-alert. Satellite SOS works only on compatible device.
Stree Suraksha
Overview

Stree Suraksha is an advanced women’s safety solution leveraging an integrated stack of AI & ML, IoT, GSM modules, Bluetooth Mesh, and satellite technology for robust threat detection and seamless emergency alerts. Combining multiple sensors—including motion detection and heart rate—this system provides multi-layered, context-aware protection, ensuring safety even in challenging or no-network environments.
Key Technologies & Integration
AI & Machine Learning

    Real-time data analysis: Trained AI/ML models analyze sensor input for abnormal physiological and motion patterns.

    Multi-step verification: ML algorithms minimize false positives, triggering alerts only on genuine threats and improving accuracy.

IoT and Multiple Sensors

    Motion sensor: Detects sudden or suspicious movements.

    Heart rate sensor: Monitors abnormalities indicating panic or distress.

    Other health sensors: (Optional) Expandable to include temperature, SpO2, etc.

    Wearable device: Smartwatch or IoT-based wearable gathers and transmits sensor data to the mobile application for live monitoring.

GSM Module

    Global cellular alerts: The GSM module ensures real-time SOS messages and live GPS location are instantly sent via cellular networks to trusted contacts and authorities.

    Primary communication method: Offers reliable wide-area coverage.

Bluetooth Mesh Networking

    Decentralized local network: Devices form an ad hoc mesh, enabling peer-to-peer SOS alert propagation when mobile networks are unavailable.

    No-network functionality: Critical in remote, underground, or disaster situations where standard connectivity fails.

Satellite Technology

    Emergency fallback: On supported devices (such as new Apple, Pixel, or Samsung phones), satellite messaging enables SOS transmission where neither GSM nor Bluetooth Mesh is available.

    Uninterrupted connectivity: Ensures last-resort help in the most isolated conditions.

User-Consent Audio Recording

    Privacy-first: Audio recording is only activated after genuine threat detection and SOS activation, and only with user permission. Records until help arrives for evidence and safety.

Benefits & Unique Advantages

    Layered safety: Multiple communication protocols (GSM, Bluetooth Mesh, satellite) guarantee alerts in any environment.

    Smart detection: AI/ML-driven sensor fusion reduces false alarms and increases user trust.

    Privacy-respecting: Audio and health data used only for real emergencies, and never without user consent.

    Dashboard: Comprehensive mobile app for event logs, live monitoring, history tracking, and device setup.

How Is Stree Suraksha Different?

Unlike traditional safety apps that rely on a single connectivity mode or manual alerts, Stree Suraksha uniquely blends AI/ML, IoT sensor fusion, GSM, decentralized Bluetooth Mesh, and satellite fallback for virtually 100% emergency coverage. The system adapts to real-world constraints, making it robust and reliable for urban and remote scenarios alike.
